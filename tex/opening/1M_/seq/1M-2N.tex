3C = 11-14 unbal or 11-12 bal
    3D = ask, resp same as below. 3M = min NF. 4M = s/o. other = nat suit MST+.
3D = extra w/o shortness
    4M = min w/o shortness. 3M = min w/ shortness.  # then +1 = ask
    3N = non-serious. other = cue.
3HSN = extra. spl  # 3oM = spl oM. 3M/3N = spl C/D.
4X = extra. 5+X. usually promise all controls.
4M = 13-14 bal.
