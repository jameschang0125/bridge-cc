\section{2C}

We use control-showing response (i.e. A = 2, K = 1) after \texttt{2C} opening. The rest are simply natural except:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item after any \texttt{2N}, we use response same as \texttt{2N} opening
    \item cheaper minor = double negative after \texttt{2C - 2D - 2S/3C}
    \item jump response shows a "one-loser suit" (KQJTxx+) without outside CT.
\end{itemize}
