2D = 0-1 CT
2H = 2 CT; 2S = AK; 3C = 4+ CT, forcing to 4N
    then nat. bal usually still 2N. will deny bidding NF bids if too strong.
    # ex: 2C - 2S; 2N - 3C; 4m/4N = nat, slam forcing
    # 2C - 2S; 2N - 3C; 3N/4N - 4C/5C = ask 4M, 4DH/5DH = transfer
2N = KKK
    then same as 2N opening
3DHS = 1-loser suit, no outside CT. 3N = same for C.
    ?  # mb ask short
