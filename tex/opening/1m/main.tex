\section{1m}

We use a very natural system for now. For jumps, I suggest: (for now)
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item jump 2X = nat 6+X inv NF. 2N = nat inv
    \item 1D - 3C = nat inv. 1D - 2C = GF.
    \item double jump 3X = nat weak, about 6-6.5 winners.
    \item these are on unless it is no longer a jump. (1m - (X) - 2N ?)
    \item two-way is off after overcalled (but not after t/o) except \texttt{1C - (1D)}
\end{itemize}

To Doizi: in GA, there are differences:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item 1m - 2H = weaker 5S4H
    \item 1m - 2S = inv(+) fit
    \item 1D - 2D = nat constr; 1C - 2C = GF (then 2D = min)
    \item After 1C - 1S; 1N: 2C = puppet 2D (then 2N/3C = inv, 2M = inv, show stopper), 2D nat inv, 2N = transfer to 3C, 3C+ = nat ST
\end{itemize}
