\section{vs 1N}

We choose the widely-used multi-Landy.

\subsection{resp to multi}

When partner makes a multi \texttt{2D} bid, there can be several possibilities for responder:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item nothing special: simply \texttt{2H} for P/C
    \item we want to play in our suit: \texttt{P} or \texttt{3C} is s/o
    \item we supports both majors, so we want to preempt: \texttt{2M/3M/4H} are all P/C. Notice that you may bid \texttt{2S} when holding \texttt{13xx} for example.
    \item we want to invite if partner is H: bid \texttt{2S}, partner will show feature if he is maximum.
    \item we want to invite if partner is S: bid \texttt{2H}, we can invite if partner correct to \texttt{2S}
    \item we want to make a general invite: bid \texttt{2N}
    \item we have our own major and GF: bid \texttt{3D}
\end{itemize}

The responses are as follows:
