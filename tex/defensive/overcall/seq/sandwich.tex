(1X) - P - (1Y) - 2X/2Y = nat, good 6-card
after (1X) - P - (1Y) - 1Z/2m:
Rubens is ON and 2Y is the cuebid suit. (i.e. transfer from 2Y)
The meaning of 2N is still the same, because it is possible to pass with 12-14 bal.

The only special case is (1C) - P - (1D) - 2D. Here we define 3C as the cuebid suit.
