\section{overcall}

\subsection{simple overcall}

Similar to take-out, an overcall is level-aware:

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/overcall}

We use Rubens when advancing an overcall:

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/basic_rubens}

\subsection{jump overcall}

The most improtant agreement for overcall IMHO is the precise definition of their strength.
Obviously it depends on partnership agreement, but hope that this section provides a good baseline.
Notice that this write-up is quite aggressive and vul-sensitive.

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/jump}
