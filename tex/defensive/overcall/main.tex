\section{overcall}

\subsection{simple overcall}

Similar to take-out, an overcall is level-aware:

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/overcall}

We use Rubens when advancing an overcall that is lower than \texttt{2m}:

\input{\currfiledir/seq/1Y}
\input{\currfiledir/seq/2m}

\subsection{sandwich position}

Overcalls are natrual and Rubens is ON. However, since advancer failed to made a direct overcall, his bids are NF and shows a NFB quality.

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/sandwich}

\subsection{jump overcall}

The most improtant agreement for overcall IMHO is the precise definition of their strength.
Obviously it depends on partnership agreement, but hope that this section provides a good baseline.
Notice that this write-up is quite aggressive and vul-sensitive.

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/jump}

\subsection{other general principles}

\textbf{Rubens} is a \textbf{whitelist convention}.
It is ON iff we made an natrual overcall lower than \texttt{2m}, and LHO passes or doubled.
