\subsection{resp}

The response is pretty standard but a bit more precisely defined. For \texttt{(2M) - X}, check \textbf{Lebonsohl}.

\input{\currfiledir/seq/resp}

For higher level t/o, we use them quite flexibly. To be precise, \texttt{(4S) - X} can have the following possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
  \item most typically: 16+ bal
  \item t/o hands weaker than 4N: ranging from -.Axx.Axxxx.Axxxx to J.AQxx.KQxx.AQxx (may judge based on Vul or opp. style)
\end{itemize}
