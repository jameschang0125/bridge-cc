[X = m] cue = any GF; or GF* w/o stopper; or 44+M inv 
    2M = 4+M. raise is the only NF bid 
        new suit = usually 5-cards except 2S after 2H
    2D/2N+ = nat and GF. basically shows 16+.  # since non-GF must have 4M.
    * I can bearly imagine but probably inv, 43M w/o stopper is acceptable.
[X = M] cue = any GF, usually no 4oM.
