\subsection{after simple overcall}

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/Rubens}

\subsection{after NT overcall}

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/Gladiator}

note: minor suit Gladiator is not very useful so I discarded it.

\subsection{after t/o}

\bin{\currfiledir/seq/1X-X}

1N - X ?
(1m) - X - (XX) - P = pen.
(1M) - X - (XX) - P = pick a suit

\subsection{overcaller rebid}

a "free" 2N rebid of a 2m overcaller is unusual (usually 6+m and 4+om)
