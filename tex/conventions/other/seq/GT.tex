sure fit in 2S - 
2N = ask
   3X = feature in X  # at least KJ/QJT. for 1D opener this is spl
   3S = min w/o feature. 4S = max w/o feature.  # 3N = CoG or non-serious ?
   4X = spl
3X = HSGT/ST in X  # request void/x/xx/Qx/A(+)/K(+)
3S = 6+S inv
3N = CoG
4C+ = spl

# for 2H: 2S = ask, and exchange the meaning of 2N and S
