- 2N is natrual and inv
- respond/advance new suit is forcing unless:
    - passed hand or failed to overcall
    - (except we are opening) opp. shows inv+
    - (except we are opening) The bidding too high (3C+), so that a forcing bid is not practical
        - note: in this case, you may directly jump to game, or X then bid to show a strong hand
- If new suit is F, X then bid is NF
- cuebid is forcing and strong
