\section{two-way}

Two way is off after overcalled (but not after t/o) except \texttt{1C - (1D)}. \\
I made some very slight modification from BTU's two-way:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item Now \texttt{2C -> 2D; 3X} shows the same hand as directly \texttt{3X}
    \item \texttt{2C -> 2D; 3N} is now pure CoG, no SI.
\end{itemize}
